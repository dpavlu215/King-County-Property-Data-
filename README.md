# King-County-Property-Data-
For this project, I found a dataset consisting of properties in the King County region of Washington state and conducted a correlation analysis on every variable with the price of each property.
From there I looked at each variable further to see if we could find any insights.
I then created a regression model in Python to show the predicted price vs. actual price of these properties based on those variables. 
I have included my Jupyter Notebook file where I created my regression model and the csv file for the original dataset.
